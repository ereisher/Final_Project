## Project Background Knowledge
### Reproducibility and Replicability
It is important to understand the difference between reproducibility and replicability 
- Reproducibility- “is obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis” (National Academies of Sciences et al., 2019). ​
- Replicability- “is obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.” National Academies of Sciences et al., 2019). ​
- Reproducibility and replicability in research are fundamental to the success of a research project (Diaba-Nuhoho et al., 2021). ​
Providing the necessary documentation for a project can ensure reproducibility
### The Reproducibility Crisis 
A 2016 survey conducted by Nature noted (Baker, 2016):
- More than 70% of researchers tried and were unable to reproduce another's work
- More than 50% failed to reproduce their own
This leads to a need for reproducible research to occur. 
### Paper Summary 
- The paper indicated that using antibiotics may change the gut microbiome and aimed to learn whether or not the gut microbiome can be recovered post use. ​
- The researchers aimed to determine if the gut microbiome could be recovered after one dose of oral co-amoxiclav before a prostate biopsy in a 5-week time period. ​
- The researchers recruited 15 patients and provided pre and post antibiotic fecal samples. The V4 region of 16srRNA was sequenced. ​
- QIIME2 was used for microbiome, alpha and beta diversities, and taxonomy analysis. LEfSe was used to visualize the differences in taxa between the 2 groups. ​
- The researchers found that the alpha and beta diversities of the 2 groups were significantly different.
## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to test if I was able to reproduce another's work and identify ways to help solve the Reproducibility Crisis. 
## Significance 
This project is needed because reproducibility in science is necessary for validation, collaboration, and results that can benefit the population. Scientific results can lead to the advancement of health, directly impacting everyone. 
## Novelty
There are reproducbility studies that exist, however, to my knowledge there is not one done on this paper nor one that presented ideas on how to make research more reproducible based on the experience.
